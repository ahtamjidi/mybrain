After a while, the lists became too long, so we implemented some macros in Excel to find more chord relationships.

	- [Mahler's 2nd Symphony, 4th movement](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsm6lDuM3JA) - heart-breakingly beautiful imo, and only 5 minutes long. Check out especially the mood he sets at 2:48, and the chord at 4:21 is a gorgeous bit of chromaticism.
	- [Brass Chorale from Mahler's 2nd Symphony, 5th movement](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUB4vGmGSdY) - sheer raw, symphonic power. Hans Zimmer's got nothing on this.
	- [Prokofiev's 3rd piano concerto, 1st movement](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQaO7v1d1ng) - this work has a rhythmic vitality that makes it stand out for me in the world of piano concertos. Prokofiev is another extremely coloristic composer, moving from flowing melodies and lush harmonies to jarring dissonances and percussive rhythms quite easily.
	- ["Mars" from Gustav Holst's _The Planets_ suite](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0bcRCCg01I) - one of the most-cited instances of his stylistic borrowing. It's very easy to hear where the Imperial March came from when you listen to this.
	- [The Promise of Living by Aaron Copland](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLVyRvp2Qbg) - one of my absolute favorite Copland pieces (I have a very personal connection to it). Appalachian Spring is also incredible if you have the time for it, but this is much shorter and quicker to listen to. Gorgeous open harmonies and lush orchestrations are what Copland is best known for in stuff like this.

- [What is the difference between a mode and a scale?](https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/5382/what-is-the-difference-between-a-mode-and-a-scale)
"Simply put, the real difference between a mode and a scale is one of tonality. A scale, in Western practice, has a tonal center to which the ear gravitates. The seventh scale step pulls the ear toward the tonic, and chords based on those half-steps feel as if they must be resolved in that direction. The statement I-V-I has a sense of going forth and coming back that is not available, or at least not available in the same way, in modal music. The tonal center in modal music is almost arbitrary and may feel imposed upon it. Given the mode, tendency toward this center ranges from identical (Ionian) to virtually non-existent, or even super-imposed (Locrian). It is this arbitrary nature of modality that gives it a distinct character that can sound so fresh and exciting in jazz and forms of rock music as well as the music of other cultures. Each mode carries with it its own character, while tonal music always uses its own tonal gravity to express the eternal comings and goings of statement and resolution. Beethoven's 9th Symphony, for example, (and Beethoven in general) may be viewed as a thorough exercise in the "complicated simplicity" of this idea.

For a better discussion of this topic than I may hope to render in a few paragraphs here, I encourage you to listen to Leonard Bernstein's master class on this very topic, rendered in four parts on YouTube. He covers the physics of modes (scale steps and all that) better than others have done here, but also illuminates the chemistry, which is after all what separates real, organic music from academic discourse."
