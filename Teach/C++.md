Please first read [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](https://norvig.com/21-days.html) by [Peter Norvig](https://norvig.com/)

We will first focus on the syntax of the language and basic knowledge of STL.  If you have some programming background a couple of good resources to brush up you C++ knowledge are 
- Book:  Stroustrup, B. (2018). "[A Tour of C++](https://www.amazon.com/Tour-C-Depth-ebook-dp-B07FW7P3D3/dp/B07FW7P3D3/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=)". Addison-Wesley Professional.
- Short Videos: These [series of short videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEOGtxYTB6vo6MQ-WQ9W_nQ) by Bo Qian. 
- For more in depth overview of the basics of C++ features the Back to Basics track of the [cppcon](https://cppcon.org/) [releases](https://www.youtube.com/user/CppCon/playlists) free and quality instructional videos. 
- The [6 part video series](https://www.aristeia.com/videos.html) on Effective Modern C++ by [Scott Meyers](https://www.aristeia.com/)
-  Blogs: [GotW](http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/) and [Fluent C++](https://www.fluentcpp.com/posts/) (I like the idea of "Daily C++ session" . Look for the post marked with it and you can read short practical C++ articles everyday.)
