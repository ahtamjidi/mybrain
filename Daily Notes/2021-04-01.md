-   ShortScience.org is a platform for post-publication discussion aiming to improve accessibility and reproducibility of research ideas.
-   The website has 1547 public summaries, mostly in machine learning, written by the community and organized by paper, conference, and year.
-   Reading summaries of papers is useful to obtain the perspective and insight of another reader, why they liked or disliked it, and their attempt to demystify complicated sections.
-   Also, writing summaries is a good exercise to understand the content of a paper because you are forced to challenge your assumptions when explaining it.
-   Finally, you can keep up to date with the flood of research by reading the latest summaries on our Twitter and Facebook pages.
