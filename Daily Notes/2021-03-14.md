Both can be used to find the shortest path from single source. BFS runs in `O(E+V)`, while Dijkstra's runs in `O((V+E)*log(V))`.

A\* is basically an informed variation of Dijkstra.  
A\* is considered a "best first search" because it greedily chooses which vertex to explore next, according to the value of `f(v)` \[`f(v) = h(v) + g(v)`\] - where `h` is the heuristic and `g` is the cost so far.

Note that if you use a non informative heuristic function: `h(v) = 0` for each `v`: you get that A\* chooses which vertex to develop next according to the "so far cost" (`g(v)`) only, same as Dijkstra's algorithm - so if `h(v) = 0`, A\* defaults to Dijkstra's Algorithm.

A\* is both complete (finds a path if one exists) and optimal (always finds the shortest path) if you use an [Admissible heuristic function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admissible_heuristic). If your function is not admissible - all bets are off.
