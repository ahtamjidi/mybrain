## Review
Title: Scalable Recursive Distributed Collaborative State  for Aided Inertial Navigation

The paper proposes a new CSE method that builds on previous work in the field and addresses the computational cost and scalability issues while keeping the same performance as the method in reference [6]. The idea behind this paper and similar methods is inspired by the Distribution Propagation work of reference [4] and it is to decompose the cross correlation between state estimates into factors so that each agent updates its own decomposed factors while it does not share a common observation with other agents. When a relative observation is made the cross correlation is recovered (fully or with a conservative approximation) and the estimates are updated such that agent benefit from each other's information. The result is a distributed cooperative state estimator. [[@chignellTutorialBestReference2018]]

The proposed method is called DAH and compared to the state of the art (DACC), the authors claim that their method decreases the computational cost in "maintenance" and "propagation" stages and make them an order of O(1), while maintaining the same estimator performance. This is achieved by introducing a buffer of static size that helps them keep track of the factorized cross covariances and update them when they are about to fall from the buffer history. Algorithms and expressions to update this buffer is provided. This method will be specially useful for CSE applications with high rate propagation and update rates (IMU is an example).

The authors show through experiments that their method results in consistent estimates that perform similar to DACC and have significantly less computational cost compared to DP during private update and propagation stages.

The paper is well written (I have some minor suggestions) and the literature survey is sufficient. The authors clearly state their contribution which to me is a valuable one. The experiments are relevant and comprehensive and support the claims made. The video attachment is useful. It would be better to link to a higher quality video for the final submission. I would also encourage the authors to share their code with the community and support reproducible research.

Based on the above assessment, I would recommend that the paper is accepted.


### Introduction
- The statement before V.C begs the question: What about the case "o" and "p" are uncorrelated. Even if it is obvious please add a short sentence to clarify.

- Same page: "a posteriori" need to be italicized.

- Page 5, at the bottom of the first column "at a rate of rate of" --> "at a rate of" 
- Page 5: "The NEES for all states should be in average 3, lower than that indicates conservatism, but all states are far from being considered in-consistent." Seems like some of the commas can be converted to ";" or you can rephrase.
