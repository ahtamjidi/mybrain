- [Riemannian Manifold Optimization Library](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~whuang2/ROPTLIBnew.htm)
- [Pymanopt](https://www.pymanopt.org/): Pymanopt is a Python toolbox for optimization on manifolds, that computes gradients and Hessians automatically. It builds upon the Matlab toolbox [Manopt](http://manopt.org/) but is otherwise independent of it. Pymanopt aims to lower the barriers for users wishing to use state of the art techniques for optimization on manifolds, by relying on automatic differentiation for computing gradients and Hessians, saving users time and saving them from potential calculation and implementiation errors.
- [ROPTLIB: an object-oriented C++ library for optimization on Riemannian manifolds](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~whuang2/papers/ROPTLIB.htm) related [paper](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~whuang2/pdf/ROPTLIB_14WH_techrep.pdf): This paper describes ROPTLIB, a C++ library for Riemannian optimization. Unlike prior packages, ROPTLIB simultaneously achieves the following goals: i) it has user-friendly interfaces in Matlab, Julia and C++; ii) users do not need to implement manifold- and algorithm-related objects; iii) it provides efficient computational time due to its C++ core; iv) it implements state-of-the-art generic Riemannian optimization algorithms, including quasi-Newton algorithms; and v) it is based on object-oriented programming, allowing users to rapidly add new algorithms and manifolds.

- [PySINDy](https://github.com/dynamicslab/pysindy): **PySINDy** is a sparse regression package with several implementations for the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical systems (SINDy) method introduced in Brunton et al. (2016a), including the unified optimization approach of Champion et al. (2019) and SINDy with control from Brunton et al. (2016b). A comprehensive literature review is given in de Silva et al. (2020).
